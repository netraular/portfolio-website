## üìå Overview

**Cosmoscape** is an educational web platform developed during the [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/), addressing the [Exosky Challenge](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/challenges/exosky/). This interactive experience transforms astronomical data into immersive visualizations of night skies from 50 confirmed exoplanets.

![Sky Visualization](https://placehold.co/400x250/2a2d32/FFF?text=Exoplanet+Sky+Preview)

Our international team (Spain/Italy, ages 21-25) created this platform to:
- Make complex NASA data accessible through creative visualization
- Foster STEM interest in young audiences
- Enable collaborative constellation creation
- Provide downloadable resources for educators

## üöÄ Educational Impact

This project bridges astronomy and digital creativity by:
- Turning raw coordinates into relatable visual stories
- Encouraging collaborative learning through shared constellation designs
- Providing open-access tools for classroom integration
- Demonstrating real-world applications of 3D web technologies

*"Our goal is to make distant worlds feel personal - when users create a constellation from Cosmoscape's sky, they're not just learning astronomy, they're building emotional connections with space."* - Development Team
