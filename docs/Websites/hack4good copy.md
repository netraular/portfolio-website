## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Eco2 is a web platform conceived and developed during the **Hack for Good 2024 hackathon in Barcelona**, where it proudly secured **1st place** amongst more than 1000 participants.

The core mission of Eco2 is to combat the environmental impact of transportation by promoting the consumption of local and sustainable products. It achieves this by assigning a unique sustainability score to products based on the proximity of their manufacturing or origin point relative to the end consumer. This score is easily accessible via a QR code label.

Eco2 serves a dual purpose:
1.  **For Consumers:** It empowers users to make more informed and eco-conscious purchasing decisions by providing transparent information about a product's journey and environmental footprint.
2.  **For Businesses:** It offers a tool to enhance supply chain transparency, showcase commitment to sustainability, and connect with environmentally aware customers.

Following the hackathon's success, the project underwent further development to refine its features for presentation at a national competition level.

## ðŸ‘¤ My Role & Contribution

As the most experienced developer on our multidisciplinary team, my role was pivotal in guiding the project from concept to award-winning prototype within the tight constraints of the hackathon. My key contributions included:

- **Team Leadership & Project Management:** I organized the project workflow, managed tasks, and facilitated communication across a diverse team comprising two bootcamp developers, one mathematics student, and two business administration students. My goal was to structure the work so everyone could contribute effectively based on their skills.
- **Technical Guidance & Mentorship:** I provided technical direction, architected the initial platform structure, and mentored the junior developers, helping them integrate their work and learn throughout the process.
- **Full-Stack Development:** I actively contributed to both front-end and back-end development, ensuring the core functionalities were implemented robustly.

My focus was on creating a collaborative and productive environment, leveraging the varied expertise within the team to build a functional and impactful solution, which was key to our success in the competition.
