## üìå Overview

**Eco2** is a web platform designed to reduce carbon footprints by encouraging the purchase of **locally manufactured, sustainable products**. It assigns an **eco-score label** to products based on their production proximity to the consumer, improving supply chain transparency for businesses and empowering eco-conscious decisions for users. 

üèÜ **1st Place Winner** at **Hack for Good Barcelona 2024** (1,000+ participants), later advancing to a national competition. Post-hackathon, the platform was further developed to include advanced features like dynamic QR tracking and role-based access.
