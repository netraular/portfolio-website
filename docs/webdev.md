## Overview

Introduce the project here. Explain:
*   What is the core purpose of this application?
*   What problem does it solve or what need does it fulfill?
*   Who is the target audience? (e.g., internal team, specific clients, general public)
*   What was your role in this project? (e.g., sole developer, lead backend, full-stack contributor)

*Example:*
"PromptPal is a web application built with Laravel designed to streamline the process of generating diverse text outputs using Large Language Models (LLMs). It allows users to create reusable templates with variables, select an LLM provider (initially Grok), and generate customized content efficiently. This project was developed solo to explore practical applications of LLM APIs in a web context."

## Technology Stack

Detail the technologies used, categorized for clarity.

### Backend

*   **Framework:** PHP / Laravel (mention version if significant)
*   **Language:** PHP (mention version if significant)
*   **Database:** MySQL (or PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
*   **APIs:** [List any external APIs used, e.g., Grok LLM API, Google Speech API, AWS Polly]
*   **Authentication:** [e.g., Laravel Sanctum, JWT, Standard Session]
*   **Other Backend Tools:** [e.g., Redis for caching/queues, Supervisor for queue workers, Bash scripts for automation]

### Frontend

*   **Templating:** Laravel Blade
*   **JavaScript:** Vanilla JS / jQuery (or React, Vue, etc.)
*   **CSS Framework:** Bootstrap (mention version)
*   **Build Tools:** [e.g., Vite, Webpack, NPM]

### Infrastructure & Deployment

*   **Web Server:** [e.g., Nginx, Apache]
*   **Hosting:** [e.g., Self-hosted VM (Proxmox), Docker Container, Cloudflare Pages, AWS EC2, DigitalOcean Droplet]
*   **Containerization:** Docker (if used)
*   **CI/CD:** [e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins] (if applicable)
*   **Version Control:** Git / GitHub (or GitLab, Bitbucket)

## Architecture (Optional but Recommended)

Provide a high-level overview of the system's architecture. A simple diagram can be very effective here.

*Explain the main components and how they interact. For a standard Laravel web app, this might involve explaining the MVC pattern, request lifecycle, database interaction, and any significant external service integrations.*

<!-- Replace with a diagram showing components like User -> Browser -> Nginx -> Laravel App -> Database -> External API -->

## Challenges and Solutions

Describe 1-2 significant technical challenges faced during development and how you overcame them. This demonstrates problem-solving skills.

*   **Challenge 1:** [Describe the challenge, e.g., Handling potentially long-running API calls to the LLM without blocking the user interface.]
    *   **Solution:** [Explain the solution, e.g., Implemented Laravel Queues with Redis and Supervisor to process LLM requests asynchronously in the background. Users receive a notification when the generation is complete.]
*   **Challenge 2:** [Describe the challenge, e.g., Designing a flexible database schema to store diverse template structures.]
    *   **Solution:** [Explain the solution, e.g., Utilized a JSON column type in MySQL to store template variable definitions, allowing for flexibility while still enabling basic querying.]

## Project Links

*   **Live Demo:** [Link to the live application, if available] `(e.g., https://promptpal.raular.com)`
*   **Source Code:** [Link to the GitHub repository] `(e.g., https://github.com/netraular/llm-prompt-combine)`
