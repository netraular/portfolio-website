# üöÄ My Technical Projects 

![Project Showcase](./attachments/showcase-header.png)

Welcome to my dynamic portfolio of technical experiments and implementations! This living documentation showcases my hands-on journey across multiple technology domains.

## üîç What You'll Discover Here

This section features detailed case studies of my personal initiatives and team collaborations, focusing on:

![Web Development](./attachments/web-dev-icon.png) **Web Development**  
Full-stack applications and experimental interfaces using modern frameworks

![IoT Setup](./attachments/iot-board.png) **Embedded Systems**  
Practical implementations with ESP32 microcontrollers and sensor networks

![Server Dashboard](./attachments/proxmox-dashboard.png) **Home Lab Management**  
Proxmox virtualization environment with self-hosted services and container orchestration

## üåü Key Focus Areas

### Cross-Domain Experimentation
My projects reflect diverse technical interests:
- Rapid prototyping methodologies
- Open-source tool implementations
- Hybrid hardware/software solutions
- Cloud-native local deployments

### Hackathon Excellence

Proud winner of the [CityTech Challenge 2023](https://example.com/hackathon-project) where we developed an IoT environmental monitoring system in 48 hours! Regular participant in coding marathons and timed challenges.

## üìö Documentation Philosophy
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Idea] --> B(Prototyping)
    B --> C{Validation}
    C -->|Success| D[Documentation]
    C -->|Failure| E[Iteration]
```

All projects follow this iterative documentation approach, capturing both successful implementations and valuable learning experiences from challenges.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Playground
