### Built with Docusaurus
This portfolio site is powered by **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)**, a modern static site generator designed for documentation and content-heavy websites. It combines Markdown-based content creation with React-powered customization, making it ideal for technical projects and developer portfolios.

### My Home Lab Setup
I self-host this website on my **home server** as part of my infrastructure experimentation. Docusaurus' static site nature makes it:
- 🚀 Lightweight and fast to serve
- 🔄 Easy to version control with Git
- ⚙️ Simple to deploy through CI/CD pipelines
- 💻 Compatible with low-resource hardware

### Why Docusaurus?
This project emerged from my need to **centralize all my projects** in one customizable space. While I previously used [wiki.js](https://js.wiki/) and [BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/), Docusaurus offers:

*Writing content in Obsidian before syncing with Docusaurus*

1. Write documentation/project notes in Obsidian using Markdown
2. Sync with Docusaurus' content directory
3. Maintain consistent formatting and links
4. Leverage Obsidian's graph view for content relationships

### Technical But Tailored
While more developer-focused than traditional wikis, Docusaurus provides:
- 🧩 Complete control over site structure
- � Easy theming and component integration
- 📚 Versioned documentation capabilities
- ⚖️ Perfect balance between simplicity and customization

### Deployment Pipeline
The site is automatically deployed via **[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)**:
