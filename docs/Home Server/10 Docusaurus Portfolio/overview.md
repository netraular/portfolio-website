## Home Server / Docusaurus Portfolio

### Built with Docusaurus
This portfolio site is powered by **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)**, a modern static site generator designed for documentation and content-heavy websites. It combines Markdown-based content creation with React-powered customization, making it ideal for technical projects and developer portfolios.

### My Home Lab Setup
I self-host this website on my **home server** as part of my infrastructure experimentation. Docusaurus' static site nature makes it:
- Lightweight and fast to serve
- Easy to version control with Git
- Simple to deploy through CI/CD pipelines
- Compatible with low-resource hardware

### Why Docusaurus?
This project emerged from my need to **centralize all my projects** in one customizable space. While I previously used [wiki.js](https://js.wiki/) and [BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/), Docusaurus offers:
- Full control over styling and components
- Better developer experience for technical content
- Native Markdown support with MDX enhancements
- Portfolio-friendly features out of the box

### Obsidian Integration
My content workflow integrates seamlessly with **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)**:
1. Write documentation/project notes in Obsidian using Markdown
2. Sync with Docusaurus' content directory
3. Maintain consistent formatting and links
4. Leverage Obsidian's graph view for content relationships

### Technical But Tailored
While more developer-focused than traditional wikis, Docusaurus provides:
- Complete control over site structure
- Easy theming and component integration
- Versioned documentation capabilities
- Perfect balance between simplicity and customization

### Deployment Pipeline
The site is automatically deployed via **[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)**:
- Instant updates on Git commits to main branch
- Global CDN distribution
- Automatic SSL encryption
- Integrated performance optimizations
- Cost-effective hosting (free tier)

This setup ensures my portfolio stays current while letting me focus on content creation rather than infrastructure management.
