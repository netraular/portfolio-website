## Home Server & Cloudflare Tunnel

### What is Cloudflare Tunnel?
[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/) (formerly Argo Tunnel) is a secure tunneling solution that allows you to expose local web services to the internet without opening firewall ports or exposing public IP addresses. It creates outbound-only connections to Cloudflare's edge network, providing an additional security layer.

### My Home Lab Implementation
In my self-hosted environment, I leverage Cloudflare Tunnel to:
- Securely expose web applications from my homelab to the internet
- Maintain granular access control through Cloudflare Zero Trust policies
- Bypass complex NAT/firewall configurations
- Host multiple services under my custom domain with automatic SSL

### Why It Matters for My Projects
This setup is essential for my web development workflow because it:
üöÄ Enables seamless sharing of project demos/presentations through my own domain  
üîí Provides enterprise-grade security for experimental projects  
üåç Allows global accessibility from any internet-connected device  
üõ†Ô∏è Simplifies deployment testing without cloud infrastructure costs  

The tunnel integration has become foundational for presenting my web projects professionally while maintaining full control over my self-hosted environment.
