## Home Server / WireGuard VPN

### What is WireGuard?
[WireGuard®](https://www.wireguard.com/) is a modern, lightweight, and secure VPN protocol designed for simplicity and high-performance tunneling. It uses state-of-the-art cryptography and integrates seamlessly into modern infrastructure. For technical details, visit the [official documentation](https://www.wireguard.com/explanation/).

### My Homelab Implementation
I’ve deployed WireGuard in my **self-hosted homelab** to enable secure remote access to internal services. Here’s how I use it:

- **Remote Access to Internal Services**:  
  WireGuard acts as a gateway to my homelab’s network, allowing me to securely access services like:
  - Local development environments
  - Media servers
  - Monitoring dashboards (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana)
  - File storage (via SMB/NFS)  
  This is especially useful when working remotely from a phone, tablet, or laptop.

- **Collaboration During Events**:  
  During hackathons or team projects, I temporarily grant teammates access to my homelab’s resources via WireGuard. This enables:
  - Shared testing environments
  - Real-time debugging
  - Secure access to databases or APIs
  - Reduced reliance on public-facing endpoints

### Configuration Highlights
```bash
# Example snippet from my server configuration (simplified)
[Interface]
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
PrivateKey = <server-private-key>
ListenPort = 51820

# Peer setup for a teammate during a hackathon
[Peer]
PublicKey = <teammate-public-key>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.3/32
```

All connections enforce AES-256 encryption and leverage WireGuard’s built-in roaming support for seamless device switching. Access is restricted via firewall rules to minimize exposure.
