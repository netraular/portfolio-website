## Home Server / WireGuard VPN

### What is WireGuard?
[WireGuardÂ®](https://www.wireguard.com/) is a modern VPN protocol that combines lightweight design with state-of-the-art cryptography. Unlike traditional VPNs, it integrates seamlessly into modern networks while maintaining minimal attack surfaces. Perfect for both personal and collaborative use cases.

### My Homelab Implementation
I run WireGuard as a secure bridge between my self-hosted services and the outside world. The VPN operates on a dedicated mini-PC (Intel NUC) with automated firewall rules and connection monitoring.

#### Key Use Cases
- **Secure Remote Access**  
  Access all homelab resources from any device:
  - Media servers (Jellyfin/Plex)
  - Development environments (VS Code Server)
  - Monitoring stacks (Grafana/Prometheus)
  - File shares (SMB/NFS/Nextcloud)

- **Event Collaboration**  
  Temporary access for teammates during hackathons:
  ```text
  1. Generate time-limited peer configs
  2. Share via QR code/encrypted message
  3. Revoke access post-event
  ```
  Enables real-time collaboration without exposing services publicly.

### Technical Configuration
```bash
# Server Configuration (Simplified)
[Interface]
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
PrivateKey = <server-private-key>
ListenPort = 51820
# Firewall rules for service isolation
PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT

# Teammate Peer Example
[Peer]
PublicKey = <teammate-public-key>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.3/32  # Restrict to specific subnets
```
