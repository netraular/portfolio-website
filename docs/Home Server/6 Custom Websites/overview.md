## Home Server / Custom Websites

I develop custom web applications primarily using **Laravel**, tailored to specific needs and hosted on my self-managed home server. [Explore the technical documentation](/docs/home-server) to learn about my implementation philosophy and architecture patterns.

### Home Lab Environment
All projects run on my **personal home lab** featuring:
- Self-hosted Ubuntu VM with automated provisioning
- Custom NGINX configurations for routing and SSL
- Isolated development/staging environments
- Resource monitoring and automated backups

### Development Approach
While most implementations follow proven methodologies from my professional experience with enterprise web development, I intentionally:
- Experiment with emerging tools in the Laravel ecosystem
- Implement alternative architectural patterns
- Test bleeding-edge PHP 8.x features
- Explore unconventional database optimizations

**Featured projects** are available in the [Websites Section](/websites) of this portfolio.

### Technical Characteristics
My typical web applications integrate:
- **Laravel Framework** (v9+/10+) core functionality
- MySQL/MariaDB databases with query optimization
- Queue workers (Redis-backed jobs/horizon)
- Custom cron-based automation
- SSH-managed deployment pipelines
- Security-hardened VM configurations
- Manual dependency integration for specific use cases
- Role-based access control systems

Each project serves as both a practical tool and a learning platform for advanced web development techniques.
