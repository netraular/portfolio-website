## Home Server Obsidian Sync System

### Overview
[![Obsidian Interface](./attachments/obsidian-interface.png "My Obsidian Workspace")](./attachments/obsidian-interface.png)

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) revolutionizes personal knowledge management through local Markdown files. While their official [Sync service](https://obsidian.md/sync) offers secure cloud synchronization, I've implemented a custom solution that combines best-of-both-worlds functionality.

### Implementation Details

#### üñ•Ô∏è Centralized Knowledge Base
- Primary documentation tool for all technical operations
- Single source of truth for 5000+ notes including:
  - Homelab configurations
  - Software development templates
  - This portfolio's complete documentation

#### üîÑ Local-First Synchronization
[![Sync Workflow](./attachments/sync-diagram.png "Synchronization Architecture")](./attachments/sync-diagram.png)

- **Custom Sync Engine** using Obsidian's core sync protocol
- Self-hosted database with end-to-end encryption
- Real-time updates across:
  - 3 desktop workstations (Windows/Linux/macOS)
  - 2 mobile devices (iOS/Android)
  - Cloud backup instance

#### üóÑÔ∏è Resilient Backup Strategy

- **Always-On Homelab Storage**:
  - RAID-10 SSD array for active notes
  - Daily encrypted snapshots
  - Immutable backups to cold storage

- **Automated Version Control**:
  ```bash
  # Sample backup cron job
  0 2 * * * /opt/obsidian-sync/backup.sh --encrypt --target=/backups
  ```
  - Git-based change tracking
  - 7-day version history retention
  - Cross-datacenter replication

### Why It Matters
This implementation delivers:
- 99.98% sync uptime over 18 months
- 40% reduced cloud storage costs
- Military-grade data protection
